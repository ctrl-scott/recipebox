# Recipe Box üç≥  
**A web-first interactive recipe card system with animations and localStorage saving**

---

## üß© Overview
The **Recipe Box** project is a front-end, standalone HTML/JavaScript/CSS application designed to demonstrate animated card interactions, localStorage saving, and modular data rendering from JSON. It replicates the tactile feeling of pulling recipe cards out of a physical box‚Äîeach recipe ‚Äúpops‚Äù out with motion, while the index and search allow filtering and quick navigation.

This educational project emphasizes:
- **Web accessibility (ARIA attributes)**
- **Modular front-end logic**
- **Animation sequencing and pausing**
- **Dynamic DOM generation**
- **Local browser persistence**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| üÉè **Animated recipe cards** | Cards smoothly pop out and slide back into the box using CSS keyframe animations. |
| üîç **Search & filter** | Users can filter recipes by title or tag dynamically. |
| üé≤ **Randomizer** | The ‚ÄúRandom‚Äù button selects a random recipe from the dataset. |
| üì¶ **Open/Close box** | Simulates opening and closing a real recipe box with pause and hold effects. |
| üíæ **Local storage saving** | Recipes can be saved to the user‚Äôs browser via `localStorage`. |
| ‚ôø **Accessibility support** | Semantic roles, labels, and ARIA attributes are included. |
| üé® **Pattern background** | Optional CSS background pattern for improved visual appeal. |

## üìú Example Recipe Data (recipes.json)

```json
[
  { "id": "lemon-bars", "title": "Sunny Lemon Bars", "time": "40 min", "tags": ["dessert","bake"], "body": "Shortbread crust, lemony custard, powdered sugar finish." },
  { "id": "skillet-ziti", "title": "Weeknight Skillet Ziti", "time": "25 min", "tags": ["pasta","one-pan"], "body": "Brown sausage, add marinara, dry ziti, water; cover and simmer." },
  { "id": "crisp-salad", "title": "Crunchy Chopped Salad", "time": "15 min", "tags": ["salad","fresh"], "body": "Romaine, cucumbers, peppers, chickpeas, feta, lemon-oregano vinaigrette." },
  { "id": "sheet-pan-chicken", "title": "Sheet-Pan Paprika Chicken", "time": "35 min", "tags": ["chicken","sheet-pan"], "body": "Toss thighs with paprika, garlic, potatoes; roast until crispy." },
  { "id": "no-knead", "title": "No-Knead Pot Bread", "time": "4 hr (hands-off)", "tags": ["bread"], "body": "Mix flour, yeast, salt, water; long rest; bake in hot Dutch oven." },
  { "id": "overnight-oats", "title": "Overnight Oats Starter", "time": "5 min + overnight", "tags": ["breakfast","make-ahead"], "body": "Rolled oats, milk, chia, dash of maple; chill and top as desired." }
]

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Loading:**
   Recipes can be defined inline or fetched from a separate `recipes.json` file:

   ```js
   fetch('recipes.json')
     .then(res => res.json())
     .then(data => {
       RECIPES = data;
       renderIndex(RECIPES);
     });
   ```

2. **Rendering & Animation:**
   Each recipe card is generated by cloning a `<template>` node, then animated using CSS keyframes (`popOut` and `slideBack`).

3. **Interactivity:**

   * `View` button opens an alert or modal.
   * `Save` button stores the recipe locally.
   * Search filters the index and dropdown in real time.

4. **Persistence:**
   Recipes saved through the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button are serialized as JSON and stored in `localStorage` under the key `savedRecipes`.

---

## üß© Accessibility

The project uses:

* `role="article"` for cards
* `aria-label` and `aria-live` for dynamic areas
* Semantic structure (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`)

This ensures screen readers can interpret dynamic state changes.

| Stack            | Description              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| HTML5            | Layout and templates     |
| CSS3             | Animation and styling    |

## üöÄ Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipebox.git
   cd recipebox
   ```

2. **Serve locally (optional):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

   Then open [http://localhost:8080/recipebox.html](http://localhost:8080/recipebox.html).

3. **Modify or expand:**

   * Edit `recipes.json` to add your own recipes.
   * Adjust animation speed in `HOLD_MS` configuration.
